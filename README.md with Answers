Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the systematic use of engineering principles to designs, develop and improve softwares.
Building reliable softwares, cost and time efficiency in the building of softwares, enhancing developement.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Birth of Software Engineering (1968-1970s)
The term "Software Engineering" was introduced at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference.
Focused on structured programming and the need for formal development processes.
2. The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s-1990s)
Programming shifted from procedural to object-oriented programming (OOP) with languages like C++ and Java.
Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism improved code reusability and maintainability.
3. Agile Development and DevOps (2000s-Present)
Agile Manifesto (2001) introduced flexible, iterative development.
DevOps emerged to streamline development and operations, improving collaboration and deployment speed.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirement Analysis – Understanding what needs to be built.
2. Planning – Estimating resources, time, and budget.
3. Design – Creating architecture and system design.
4. Development – Writing and implementing code.
5. Testing – Ensuring the software works correctly.
6. Deployment – Releasing the software to users.
7. Maintenance – Fixing issues and updating software over time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall software methodology follows a sequencial kind of a structure where modification is not easy and testing happens at the end of the building eg building an ATM machine
whereas Agile mothodology follows a flexible structure hence modification is easy and continous eg building a mobile App.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. A software Developer writes and maintains  codes, he understands and translates the problem into a code.
2. A Quality assurance engineer tests codes, identifies and reports bugs.
3. Project Manager oversees the development process, ensures deadlines, deadlines are met.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. IDEs helps writing and tracking codes eg Visual Studio codes
2. VCS helps in collaborations when codding eg Git, GitHub.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Meeting deadlines- can be mitigated by proper time management.
2. Bugs_ use of Agile Methodology to keep testing along the process.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing – Tests individual components (e.g., testing a login function).
2. Integration Testing – Ensures different modules work together.
3. System Testing – Tests the entire system end-to-end.
4. Acceptance Testing – Confirms software meets user requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting appropriate prompts or commands to acquire the right responses from the AI

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: Tell me about history.
Improved Prompt: Give me a brief history of ancient Egyptian civilization, focusing on their major achievements.

Why is the improved prompt better?

More specific (ancient Egyptian civilization).
Defines scope (major achievements).
Increases accuracy of AI respons
